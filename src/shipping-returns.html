                        <h3>Shipping Information</h3>

                        <p>
                            Every watch on our site is in stock and generally ships out within one (1) business day of
                            receipt of your order and verification (settlement) from our bank/credit card company. All
                            domestic orders are shipped FedEx overnight and are fully insured at no charge to the
                            customer.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Payment by Credit Card</h3>

                        <p>
                            Orders paid by credit card will be shipped only after the credit card company has approved
                            and "settled" the order. This is normally done each day at 6pm PST on the day of the order if
                            placed before 2pm PST – so your order will ship out the very next business day. Orders
                            placed after 2pm PST will generally ship out the 2nd business day. Please note that all
                            orders must be shipped to the address on file with your credit card company. If you would
                            like your order shipped to an address that is different, other than the one on record with
                            the issuing bank, we ask that you contact your credit card company by calling the phone
                            number on the back of your credit card, and request to place an “alternate shipping address”
                            on record, so that we can verify this information. By stating that you want an “alternate
                            shipping address” it will simply be a notation on your record and should not cause any
                            change in your billing information. It is another fraud-prevention method that we use to be
                            certain that we are dealing with the actual cardholder.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Estimated delivery dates are based upon orders received by 2pm PST, Monday through Friday,
                            excluding holidays. If your order is placed and approved before 2pm PST Monday through
                            Friday, it will generally ship on the next business day. Orders placed after 2pm PST on
                            Friday generally ship on Tuesday. No orders are shipped or delivered on weekends or
                            holidays. We cannot guarantee any particular delivery date. Items ordered together may ship
                            separately.

                        <p>
                            Orders paid by wire will be shipped on the day we receive confirmation of the funds from our
                            bank. The cut off time to receive incoming wires is 3pm PST. Please note that we accept wire
                            transfers only. No ACH'es or other forms of electronic transfer will be accepted. Please
                            note that orders will be cancelled for non-payment two full business days after the order
                            has been placed without receiving funds or a proper confirmation.

                            from Google Merchant Services. We cannot ship until this approval occurs. Approvals received
                            by 3pm PST will ship that same day and approvals received after 3pm PST will ship the next
                            business day.

                            If you are an international customer we do offer shipping for additional fees. Only wired
                            payments will be accepted on international orders.

                        <h3>Sales and Use Tax Notice</h3>

                        <p>
                            Recently many states have issued guidance regarding purchases for which residents did not pay
                            sales tax. When sales tax is not charged, use tax may be due on transactions that may have
                            otherwise been taxable. It follows the same rules and requirements as sales tax.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are three common instances where a use tax obligation may occur: ordering from a
                            mail-order catalog; buying over the internet; or buying goods in another state but having the
                            merchant ship the goods to you in your resident state as opposed to you taking possession of
                            them in the store.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In all of these circumstances, if sales tax is not charged and the goods are shipped to you
                            in your resident state, you may owe use tax to your resident state. Use tax is not owed if
                            you pay another state’s sales tax on the purchase.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Remember though that not all internet and mail-order catalog purchases are subject to use
                            tax. Please refer to your local city, county, or state taxing agency for questions on whether
                            use tax may be applicable to your purchase.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The above "Sales and Use Tax Notice" is intended for general guidance and informational

                        <p>
                            At WatchCash, it is our goal to ensure that every customer is 100% satisfied with their
                            purchase. To that end, we offer a "no questions asked" 3 day refund on all purchases subject
                            to the following conditions. Products that have been worn, altered or damaged will not be
                            accepted for a full refund. Any pre-owned watch may be returned provided the watch is in the
                            exact same condition as it was sold and includes all the boxes, papers, books and
                            accessories. Please inform one of our representatives of your intention to return the watch
                            before you ship the merchandise. All return shipments must be post marked before the 3rd
                            calendar day from receipt of your watch and are sent at your sole cost and expense. Please be
                            sure to insure the contents for their full value as we are not responsible for lost
                            packages. Upon receipt, all items will undergo a thorough inspection by one of our watch
                            experts to ensure that the watch is in the original condition in which it was sold and it
                            includes all tags (especially any "non-removable" tags), items/accessories, etc before we
                            will issue a refund. Upon completion of the inspection we will refund the purchase price less
                            any return shipping and insurance fees paid by WatchCash and any transaction fees (i.e.
                            credit card, Amazon, financing or PayPal fees). This return policy is for on-line sales only:
                            all in-store sales and International sales are final.

                        <p>
                            These items are being sold in unused/unworn condition and come with the original Rolex
                            factory stickers. Removing these factory stickers will significantly impact the value and
                            resalability of this watch. Therefore, these stickers must not be removed in order to be
                            eligible for a full refund. Any watches returned with these factory stickers removed will be
                            addressed on a case-by-case basis, but could decrease the refund by as much as 20% of the
                            purchase price.
