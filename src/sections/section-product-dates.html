        <h2>Rolex Serial Numbers
            With Production Dates</h2>
        <div class="numbers__block-content-inner">
            <p>The Rolex serial numbers are found between the lugs on the side of the case at the 6 o'clock side, behind
                the bracelet. This 4-8 digit number is engraved by Rolex on every watch and it can be used to determine
                its production date. Beginning in 2005, the Company started to also engrave the serial number on the
                inside flange (or "rehaut" as it's called in French) between the dial and the crystal.

                Starting in 2008, the Company began to only engrave the numbers on the rehaut. We provide this verified
                database chart for those folks looking for an answer to an often asked question, "where or how do I find
                the Rolex serial numbers on my watch."
