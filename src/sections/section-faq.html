                            Whether at a location near you or online, there are several ways that you can sell Rolex
                            watches. But some are better than others. Pawn shops and jewelry stores near you will always
                            offer you very low prices for your Rolex watch. This is because of their high overheads and
                            lack of knowledge needed to properly value Rolex watches. Online can offer you better
                            prices, but you must be wary of the website you choose. Craigslist can certainly be
                            dangerous since you have to meet up with a complete stranger with an expensive timepiece in
                            hand. Unfortunately, eBay doesn’t do enough to protect the sellers and almost always takes
                            the side of the buyer when conflicts arise. This means you could end up with a returned (and
                            damaged) Rolex without any reimbursement whatsoever.
